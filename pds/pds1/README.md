### **General info:**
This is an implementation that calculates the number of triangles within a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) using some parallel programming stuff of C programming language. Each graph is represented by their [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix). Due to the fact that the adjacency matrix is [sparse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix), the technique of CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) format is used. Feel free to download end edit the code.
