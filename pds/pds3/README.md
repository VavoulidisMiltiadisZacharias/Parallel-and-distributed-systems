### **General info:**
This is an implementation that updates the values of a spherical [lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)) many times using CUDA.
Uploaded code does not work properly (does not even compile). I have faced huge problems due to the fact that my system does not contain NVIDIA graphics card. So the main reason,
of source code upload, is to make my idea public and...ask for help. Feel free to download and (probably) edit the code.

### **System requirements:**
NVIDIA graphics card
<br/>
<br/>

### **Setup:**
*This section will be filled with more useful info soon*.
<br/>
<br/>

### **Complete stuff:**
The following is a short explanation of each version.<br/>

- V0:<br/> Contains the source code for the (only) sequential implementation. This implementation takes place just for reference reasons.<br/><br/>
- V1:<br/> Contains the source code for the parallel implementation using CUDA.<br/><br/>
- V2:<br/> Contains the source code for the parallel implementation using CUDA(updated version).<br/><br/>
- V3:<br/> Contains the source code for the parallel implementation using CUDA(even more updated version).<br/><br/>
